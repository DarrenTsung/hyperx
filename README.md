# hyper*x*

Hyper is the low-level HTTP implementation for Rust. Hyper*x* is an
e*x*traction of the hyper 0.11 typed header module, with minimized
dependencies, for continued use with hyper 0.12 (current master),
where this module was dropped in preference to the byte-oriented
`http::header` module.
