# hyper_x_

Hyper is the low-level HTTP implementation for Rust. Hyper_x_ is an
e_x_traction of the hyper 0.11 typed header module, with minimized
dependencies, for continued use with hyper 0.12 (current master, work
in progress), where this module was dropped in preference to the
byte-oriented `http::header` module.
